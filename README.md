# Dockerfile for Axle-Base

This repository creates a lightweight Docker container used solely for hosting
volumes. It is just a wrapper for the 1.5mb, full-chain, internet enabled
busybox container located
[here](https://index.docker.io/u/radial/busybox/), but renamed to keep
consistent with the [Radial](https://github.com/radial) naming scheme.
